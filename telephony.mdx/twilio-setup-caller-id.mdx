### 6. Caller ID Best Practices

| Do | Don’t |
|----|-------|
| Use **local numbers** per area | Use **toll-free** for local leads |
| Verify **all outbound numbers** | Call unverified → blocked |
| Match **CNAM** to business name | Generic “Unknown” |

---
<Tip>
Buy **10-digit local numbers** — 3x higher connect rate.
</Tip>

---
<Note>
All calls are **recorded**, **transcribed**, and **logged in CRM**.
