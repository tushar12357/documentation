## Welcome

The CloserX.ai API enables programmatic management of AI-driven communication, including agent configuration, campaign execution, contact management, telephony integration, and more. 


## Authentication

All CloserX.ai API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate, obtain an API key via the /auth/login endpoint or use the /auth/refresh endpoint to refresh an existing token. The token must be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for all requests.


```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
