## Webhooks & Events Overview  
Webhooks allow your platform to **notify external systems or applications in real-time** whenever specific events occur. This is essential for automation, integrations, and proactive monitoring of AI agent campaigns.

---

## 1. Purpose of Webhooks  
- Trigger actions in external systems (CRM, Slack, Zapier) automatically.  
- Receive real-time notifications for **call events, agent activity, or campaign milestones**.  
- Enable **automated workflows** without manual monitoring.  
- Improve **reporting and analytics** by sending event data to dashboards or databases.  

---

## 2. Supported Events  
Common events you can monitor and act upon via webhooks:  
- **Call Started / Completed** – Track calls in real-time.  
- **Call Outcome Recorded** – Log conversions, follow-ups, or failed calls.  
- **Agent Response Events** – Capture specific responses or script branches.  
- **Campaign Status Changes** – Notify when campaigns start, pause, or end.  
- **System Alerts** – Low credits, failed calls, or telephony errors.

## 3. Setting Up Webhooks  
1. Navigate to *Monitor → Webhooks & Events*.  
2. Click **Add New Webhook** and provide:  
   - **Endpoint URL** – Where event data should be sent.  
   - **Event types** – Select which events trigger this webhook.  
   - **Authentication / Secret Key** – Optional security for verification.  
3. Save the webhook and **test** with sample events.  
4. Monitor logs to ensure events are **received correctly**.

## 4. Best Practices  
- Use **secure HTTPS endpoints** to protect event data.  
- Only subscribe to **relevant events** to reduce noise.  
- Implement **retry logic** on your endpoint to handle temporary failures.  
- Log events locally for auditing and troubleshooting.  
- Combine webhooks with dashboards for **real-time monitoring and analytics**.

<Tip>  
Webhooks are powerful for automating workflows and keeping your team or systems informed in real-time. Test thoroughly before relying on them for critical processes.
