## Monitor Overview  
Monitoring ensures your AI agents perform reliably, calls are executed correctly, and campaigns achieve expected outcomes. It allows you to **track performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize interactions**.

---

## 1. Purpose of Monitoring  
- Track **agent performance** and conversation quality.  
- Review **call outcomes, logs, and transcripts**.  
- Ensure proper functioning of **telephony, SMS, and omnichannel workflows**.  
- Identify areas for **script, prompt, or knowledge base improvement**.  

---

## 2. Monitoring Tools  
- **Real-time Dashboards:** Overview of active campaigns, call status, and agent activity.  
- **Call Logs & Transcripts:** Detailed logs for every call with timestamps, audio, and text transcripts.  
- **Outcome Metrics:** Success rate, appointments booked, follow-up needed, call duration.  
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Automated alerts via webhooks or emails for important events.

## 3. Best Practices  
- Regularly review **dashboards** to ensure agents are performing as expected.  
- Analyze **transcripts** to refine scripts, prompts, and knowledge base entries.  
- Use **metrics** to optimize batch dialing, retry logic, and agent allocation.  
- Set up **alerts** for system errors, call failures, or low credit thresholds.
