## Reliability & SLA Overview  
Reliability ensures that your AI agents and campaigns perform consistently without unexpected downtime. The Service-Level Agreement (SLA) defines the platformâ€™s **commitment to uptime, performance, and support**.

---

## 1. Purpose of Reliability Monitoring  
- Ensure **continuous availability** of AI agents for inbound and outbound calls.  
- Detect and resolve **telephony, system, or API issues** promptly.  
- Measure platform performance against **agreed SLAs**.  
- Build confidence for **critical business operations** dependent on AI agents.

## 2. Key Metrics  
- **Uptime:** Percentage of time the platform and telephony services are available.  
- **Response Time:** Average latency for agent responses and API calls.  
- **Error Rates:** Failed calls, system errors, or dropped connections.  
- **Incident Reports:** Records of outages, disruptions, or degraded service.

## 3. SLA Commitments  
- Guaranteed **uptime percentage** (e.g., 99.9% monthly).  
- Defined **response and resolution times** for support tickets.  
- Notification of **planned maintenance** in advance.  
- Support for **critical issues** via priority channels.  

---

## 4. Best Practices  
- Regularly monitor dashboards and alerts for **system performance metrics**.
