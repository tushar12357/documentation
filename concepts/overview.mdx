## What is CloserX?

**CloserX** is an **AI-driven calling platform** that empowers businesses to deploy white-labeled conversational AI agents capable of handling customer calls, lead nurturing, and appointment scheduling — all without human intervention.

At its core, CloserX combines **speech recognition**, **AI reasoning**, and **CRM integration** to deliver a fully automated calling experience.

## Key Concepts

### 1. AI Calling Agents

CloserX allows you to create and manage **custom voice agents** trained to perform specific business tasks — such as lead qualification, appointment booking, and customer support. These agents can use multiple **AI backends** including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Retell AI.

### 2. White-Label Platform

Businesses can brand CloserX under their own domain, logo, and theme. The **white-label** capabilities allow agencies and SaaS providers to resell CloserX under their own identity.

### 3. Integration Ecosystem

CloserX seamlessly integrates with:

- **CRMs** like GoHighLevel  
- **Communication APIs** such as Twilio  
- **Automation tools** including Zapier and Make  
- **Payment systems** such as Stripe  

These integrations help users automate workflows, manage billing, and synchronize customer data in real-time.

### 4. Multi-Agent Architecture

The system supports **multiple AI agents per account**, each with distinct roles, scripts, and personalities. This architecture enables handling of diverse use cases — from sales to support — simultaneously.

### 5. Real-Time Intelligence

CloserX uses AI inference and **webhook-based updates** to provide real-time status of calls, messages, and lead activity.
