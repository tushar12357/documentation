## Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AI Voice Agent** | A software-driven voice caller that uses artificial intelligence to make calls, engage with prospects or customers, handle responses, and perform tasks like appointment booking or lead qualification. |
| **White-Label Instance** | A version of the platform branded and themed for a specific business or agency, allowing resale under that brand’s logo, domain, and colors. |
| **Calling Credit / Call Credit** | Units purchased (or allocated) for consuming outbound/inbound call minutes and agent usage within the system — tracked for billing and usage. |
| **Campaign Template** | A pre-built call flow script with prompts, agent-behaviour definitions, and logic, ready to be customized for specific use-cases (e.g., appointment booking, lead follow-up). |
| **CRM Integration** | The connection between the calling platform and Customer Relationship Management systems (e.g., lead import/export, outcome sync) that keeps customer data in sync. |
| **Batch Dialing** | The ability to upload multiple leads and initiate a high-volume outbound campaign in one go, with the system utilising many AI agents in parallel. |
| **Webhook Event** | A real-time notification sent from the platform to an external URL when a defined event occurs (e.g., call completed, lead booked, call outcome logged). |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture** | A design in which multiple distinct AI voice agents operate concurrently, each configured with different scripts, behaviours, or roles to cover diverse tasks. |
| **Post-Call Analysis** | The process of analysing the results of each call (transcript, outcome, booking status) and generating insights and metrics for dashboard and automation. |
| **Telephony Integration** | The backend connection to phone networks or SIP trunks that enables inbound and outbound calling — including number provisioning, DNC compliance, voice-routing. |
| **Script / Call Flow** | A defined sequence of prompts, responses, decision nodes and agent behaviour logic used by the AI agent during a call. |
| **Agent Personality** | The configured “persona” of an AI agent — language style, tone of voice, persona back-story, allowed deviation — to make calls sound human and natural. |
| **Latency / Tick** | The delay between an event (e.g., user says something) and agent response — important in voice applications for natural feel and performance monitoring. |
| **Billing Module** | The subsystem handling usage tracking (call minutes, credits), subscription tiers, payment processing (e.g., via Stripe) and reseller revenue flows. |
