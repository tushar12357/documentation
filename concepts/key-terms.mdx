## Key Terms Glossary

| Term                        | Definition |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| **AI Voice Agent**          | A configured AI-powered caller that engages with prospects or customers over the phone, following a script or dynamic logic, and executes tasks like booking appointments or capturing qualifying information. |
| **White-Label Instance**    | A fully branded version of the platform (including domain, logo, colour scheme) offered to agencies or businesses, enabling them to resell the service under their brand. |
| **Calling Credit / Call Credit** | Units purchased (or allocated) for call usage — often based on minutes or call outcomes — used to track consumption and billing for outbound and/or inbound calls. |
| **Campaign Template**       | A pre-built call flow or script (with prompts, decision-nodes, audio assets) tailored to a specific use-case (e.g., lead qualification, appointment setting) ready for customisation and launch. |
| **CRM Integration**         | Connection between the calling platform and external customer data systems (CRMs) to import leads, export outcomes, update records, or trigger workflows. |
| **Batch Dialing**           | The process of uploading a set of leads and initiating multiple calls in parallel or in a sequence, managed via the platform’s campaign features. |
| **Webhook Event**           | A real-time notification sent from the platform to an external endpoint when a defined event occurs (e.g., call completed, booking confirmed, agent triggered). |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture**| A system design enabling multiple AI voice agents (each possibly with different scripts/personas) to operate concurrently under an account or across sub-accounts, enabling scalability and segmented campaigns. |
| **Post-Call Analysis**      | The process of analysing each call’s transcript, outcome, metrics (duration, booking status, sentiment) and surfacing these in dashboards or via API/webhooks for optimisation. |
| **Telephony Integration**   | The backend connection to tele-communication systems (such as SIP trunks, VoIP providers, phone-networks) enabling inbound/outbound voice calls, number provisioning, routing and compliance. |
| **Script / Call Flow**      | The structured sequence of prompts, questions, responses, branches and logic that the voice agent follows during a call — like a decision-tree for an AI caller. |
| **Agent Personality**       | The configured “persona” of an AI voice agent — tone, voice style, accent, allowed deviation — to make calls feel more natural, human-like, and suited to the campaign’s audience. |
| **Latency / Tick**          | The time delay between an event (e.g., a user response) and the system’s reaction (e.g., agent reply) — important in voice apps to preserve conversational flow and natural rhythm. |
| **Billing Module**          | The subsystem that tracks usage (call minutes, credits consumed), subscription tiers, payment processing, reseller margins, and credit expiry logic. |
