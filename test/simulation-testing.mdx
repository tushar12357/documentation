## Simulation Testing Overview  
**Simulation Testing** allows you to run AI agent calls in a controlled, automated environment. Unlike the playground mode, simulations can mimic real-world campaigns at scale, including multiple leads, call timing, and branching scenarios.

---

## 1. Purpose of Simulation Testing  
- Validate agent performance under real-world conditions.  
- Test **multi-agent campaigns** with varied scripts and prompts.  
- Measure **response accuracy, knowledge base usage, and call outcomes**.  
- Identify potential failures in **telephony settings, retry logic, or branching paths**.  
- Assess overall system **latency, concurrency handling, and scalability**.  

---

## 2. Setting Up a Simulation  
1. Navigate to *Testing â†’ Simulation Testing*.  
2. Select the **agent(s)** to include in the simulation.  
3. Upload or select a **lead dataset** to simulate real calls.  
4. Configure **call parameters**:
   - Start times, time windows, concurrency limits.  
   - Retry rules and fallback handling.  
5. Choose **test scenarios**: normal calls, edge cases, voicemail, or missed calls.  

---

## 3. Running the Simulation  
- Start the simulation to execute calls automatically.  
- Monitor **agent responses, call outcomes, and knowledge base interactions** in real-time.  
- Collect **metrics and logs** for later analysis.  

---

## 4. Key Metrics to Monitor  
- **Call success rate:** How many calls completed successfully.  
- **Response correctness:** Accuracy of agent replies and outcome recordings.  
- **Knowledge base accuracy:** Correct retrieval of information.  
- **Latency and pacing:** Time taken for agent responses.  
- **Error logs:** Failed calls, unhandled responses, or system errors.  

---

## 5. Iterating Post-Simulation  
- Review simulation results and identify **script or prompt adjustments**.  
- Refine **knowledge base entries** or variable mappings.  
- Re-run simulations after adjustments to ensure improvements.  
- Only deploy live after agents consistently pass simulation tests.

<Tip>  
Simulation testing is crucial for **scaling campaigns safely**. Use it to catch edge cases, verify agent reliability, and optimize scripts before engaging real leads.
