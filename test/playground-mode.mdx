## Playground Mode Overview  
**Playground Mode** allows you to simulate AI agent conversations without affecting live campaigns. It’s a safe environment to test scripts, prompts, voice settings, and knowledge base integrations.

---

## 1. Purpose of Playground Mode  
- Validate conversation flow and agent behavior.  
- Test prompt responses and branching logic.  
- Check knowledge base retrieval and dynamic variable replacement.  
- Evaluate voice, accent, and tone in a controlled setting.  
- Identify errors, latency, or unnatural responses before live deployment.  

---

## 2. Using Playground Mode  
1. Navigate to *Agents → Playground*.  
2. Select the **agent** you want to test.  
3. Choose a **scenario** or start a new conversation.  
4. Enter simulated lead responses or allow the agent to generate them automatically.  
5. Monitor the **transcript, agent responses, and knowledge base lookups** in real-time.  
6. Make adjustments to prompts, scripts, or settings as needed.

## 3. Features of Playground Mode  
- **Step-through simulation:** Move through scripts step by step to verify branching logic.  
- **Variable injection:** Test dynamic insertion of lead data (e.g., `{lead_name}`, `{product}`).  
- **Voice preview:** Hear the agent speak in the configured language, accent, and tone.  
- **Error logging:** Identify errors, unhandled responses, or failed knowledge base lookups.  

---

## 4. Best Practices  
- Start with **simple scripts** before testing complex branching.  
- Test **edge cases** to ensure robust agent behavior.  
- Use **multiple test scenarios** to cover varied lead responses.  
- Refine prompts and scripts based on observations before moving to live calls.

<Tip>  
Playground Mode is the safest way to iterate quickly. Always test changes here before deploying to live campaigns to avoid costly mistakes and maintain lead engagement.
