## How to Test Agents

**Never launch untested.**  
Use the **Playground**, **Simulation Mode**, and **Live Preview** to ensure your AI sounds natural, handles objections, and books appointments — all without spending credits.

### 1. Open the Testing Playground
- Go to **Agents** → Select your agent → Click **Test in Playground**
- Or: **Dashboard** → **Playground** → Drag your agent in

---

### 2. Test Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| **Text Simulation** | Type user replies | Free |
| **Voice Input** | Speak into mic | Free |
| **Audio Upload** | Test with real call recordings | Free |
| **Live Preview** | Call your agent from your phone | 1 credit |

---

### 3. Run a Full Test Script

#### Example: Dental Booking Agent

| Step | You Say/Type | Expected AI Response |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | "Hi, I need to book an appointment" | "Great! May I have your full name?" |
| 2 | "John Smith" | "Thanks, John. Are you a new or returning patient?" |
| 3 | "New" | "Welcome! When are you available next week?" |
| 4 | "Tuesday at 3pm" | "Perfect. I’ve booked you with Dr. Lee on Tuesday at 3pm. You’ll get a confirmation text." |

Click **Run Full Script** to auto-play.

### 4. Review Performance Score

After each test, get an **AI Scorecard**:

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Naturalness** | 9.2/10 | Pauses perfect |
| **Goal Completion** | 100% | Booking made |
| **Objection Handling** | 8.5/10 | Could improve "too busy" |
| **Latency** | 420ms | Fast |

---

### 5. Debug & Fix

- **Red highlights** = AI failed or went off-script
- Click any line → **Edit Prompt** → Fix logic
- Re-run test instantly

---

### 6. Client Handoff (Agency Workflow)

1. **Clone** tested agent → `ClientX - Final`
2. Run **client-specific test script** (their name, number, brand)
3. Record **demo call** in Playground
4. Click **Share Demo** → Send secure link to client
5. Deploy to **Client Portal** → They see **"Your AI is live and tested"**

---
<Tip>
Always test **3 scenarios**:  
1. Ideal path  
2. Objection ("I’m busy")  
3. Edge case (wrong input)
</Tip>

<Note>
All tests are **private** — no data leaves your account.
