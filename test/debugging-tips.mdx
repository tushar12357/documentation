## Debugging Tips Overview  
Debugging ensures your AI agent operates smoothly and handles calls as expected. By systematically identifying and fixing issues, you improve agent reliability and lead engagement.

---

## 1. Common Issues to Check  
- **Incorrect or off-script responses:** Prompt or script logic issues.  
- **Knowledge base errors:** Missing data, incorrect retrieval, or misformatted entries.  
- **Variable substitution errors:** Dynamic fields not populating correctly (e.g., `{lead_name}`).  
- **Telephony problems:** Call drops, voicemail mishandling, or retry failures.  
- **Latency or response delays:** Agent taking too long to reply.  
- **Audio issues:** Mispronunciations, stuttering, wrong tone or accent.

## 2. Debugging Workflow  
1. **Review Logs & Transcripts:** Identify patterns or repeated errors.  
2. **Use Playground / Simulation Testing:** Reproduce the issue in a controlled environment.  
3. **Check Prompt & Script Logic:** Ensure correct branching and fallback instructions.  
4. **Verify Knowledge Base & Variables:** Ensure data sources are connected and variables are accurate.  
5. **Test Audio & Voice Settings:** Confirm proper pronunciation, tone, and pacing.  
6. **Adjust & Retest:** Make incremental changes and re-run tests until the issue is resolved.

## 3. Tools for Debugging  
- **Playground Mode:** Step-through simulation and real-time testing.  
- **Simulation Testing:** Large-scale scenario testing to catch edge cases.  
- **Call Replays:** Review actual agent calls to pinpoint errors.  
- **Logs & Metrics Dashboards:** Monitor call outcomes, response latency, and errors.  

---

## 4. Best Practices  
- Tackle **one issue at a time** to avoid introducing new problems.  
- Keep **versioned scripts and prompts** for easy rollback.  
- Document frequent issues and fixes to build an internal troubleshooting guide.  
- Test thoroughly after every change, especially in **high-stakes campaigns**.

<Tip>  
Effective debugging is iterative. Combine logs, simulations, and call replays to systematically identify root causes and improve agent performance.
