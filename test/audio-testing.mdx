## Audio Testing Overview  
**Audio Testing** ensures your AI agent speaks clearly, naturally, and with the correct tone, accent, and pacing. This is critical for lead engagement and overall call quality.

---

## 1. Purpose of Audio Testing  
- Verify **voice clarity** and pronunciation.  
- Test **accent, language, and tone** for consistency.  
- Check **speech speed and pacing** for natural conversation flow.  
- Ensure dynamic variables (e.g., `{lead_name}`) are pronounced correctly.  
- Identify issues in **voicemail or multi-turn conversations**.  

---

## 2. Setting Up Audio Tests  
1. Navigate to *Testing → Audio Testing*.  
2. Select the **agent** you want to test.  
3. Choose a **script segment or full call** for testing.  
4. Configure **voice parameters**:  
   - Language and accent.  
   - Tone, pitch, and speed settings.  
5. Include **dynamic variables** to test personalization.

## 3. Running the Audio Test  
- Play the test call or script segment.  
- Listen for **clarity, pronunciation, and naturalness**.  
- Check for **stuttering, mispronunciations, or unnatural pauses**.  
- Adjust voice settings or prompts as needed.  

---

## 4. Best Practices  
- Test multiple **script segments**, not just the opening lines.  
- Include **edge cases** (long names, unusual terms) to ensure accuracy.  
- Record and compare audio across **different voice models**.  
- Keep a log of changes to **track improvements** over time.

<Tip>  
High-quality audio increases lead trust and engagement. Regularly test your agent’s voice, especially after prompt changes or updates to voice models.
