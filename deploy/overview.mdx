## Deploy Overview  
Deployment is the process of taking your AI agents from testing to **live campaigns**. Proper deployment ensures agents operate correctly, engage leads effectively, and capture accurate call outcomes.

---

## 1. Purpose of Deployment  
- Make AI agents available for real leads or customers.  
- Track performance metrics and campaign outcomes.  
- Ensure agents interact correctly with knowledge bases, prompts, and telephony systems.  
- Enable scaling and management of multiple campaigns.  

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist  
Before launching a live campaign, verify:  
- Agent scripts and prompts are fully tested in **playground and simulation modes**.  
- Knowledge base integration is complete and accurate.  
- Voice, language, and accent settings are correct.  
- Telephony settings are configured: caller ID, retry rules, voicemail handling.  
- Outcome fields and CRM integrations are properly mapped.  
- Credits or calling limits are available for the campaign.

## 3. Launching a Campaign  
1. Navigate to *Campaigns â†’ Create New Campaign*.  
2. Select the **AI agent(s)** to assign.  
3. Upload or select the **lead list**.  
4. Configure **campaign settings**: time windows, concurrency limits, retries.  
5. Preview or test the campaign with a small batch if possible.  
6. Click **Launch** to start live calls.

## 4. Monitoring Live Campaigns  
- Monitor **call outcomes** in real-time.  
- Track **agent performance metrics**: success rate, response accuracy, knowledge base usage.  
- Review **call transcripts and audio** for quality assurance.  
- Adjust scripts, prompts, or agent settings as needed.  

---

## 5. Best Practices  
- Start with a **small pilot campaign** to validate performance.  
- Monitor closely in the first few hours or days.  
- Maintain a feedback loop to **update prompts, scripts, or KB** based on real-world results.  
- Ensure agents comply with **legal and regulatory guidelines** for calling.

<Tip>  
Launching a campaign is the final step in the build-test-deploy cycle. Use data from live campaigns to continuously improve agent scripts, prompts, and performance.
