## Outbound Calls Overview  
Outbound calls are initiated by AI agents to leads or customers. Proper setup ensures calls are made efficiently, agents follow scripts, and outcomes are recorded accurately.

---

## 1. Purpose of Outbound Call Campaigns  
- Automate lead follow-ups and appointment scheduling.  
- Deliver consistent, high-quality conversations.  
- Maximize contact rate with proper dialing strategies.  
- Record call outcomes for reporting and CRM integration.  

---

## 2. Setting Up Outbound Calls  
1. Navigate to *Campaigns â†’ Create New Campaign*.  
2. Select the **AI agent(s)** to use.  
3. Upload or select a **lead list**.  
4. Configure **dialing settings**:  
   - Time windows (when calls are allowed).  
   - Retry logic for unanswered calls.  
   - Concurrency limits (number of simultaneous calls).  
5. Assign a **caller ID** or outbound number.  
6. Optionally configure **SMS fallback or omnichannel options**.

## 3. Agent Behavior for Outbound Calls  
- **Opening Script:** Agent starts conversation with a pre-defined greeting.  
- **Dynamic Prompts:** Agent responds based on lead answers.  
- **Branching Logic:** Follows conditional flows for yes/no, objections, or custom responses.  
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Accesses KB to answer lead queries accurately.  
- **Outcome Logging:** Captures call results, booked appointments, or follow-up needs.  

---

## 4. Testing Outbound Calls  
- Use **playground or simulation mode** to test outbound scripts.  
- Check branching logic, variable insertion, and knowledge base responses.  
- Test with a small batch of leads before full-scale deployment.  

---

## 5. Best Practices  
- Segment leads and tailor scripts to improve engagement.  
- Monitor agent performance metrics and call outcomes.  
- Adjust retry logic and calling hours for optimal contact rates.  
- Continuously refine prompts, scripts, and KB based on campaign performance.

<Tip>  
Start with a pilot outbound campaign to validate agent behavior and system settings. Gradually scale once results meet quality and conversion expectations.
