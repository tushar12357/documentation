## Batch Dialing & Limits Overview  
Batch dialing allows AI agents to make calls in controlled batches, ensuring optimal call handling, avoiding overload, and respecting campaign limits. Proper configuration helps maximize efficiency and compliance.

---

## 1. Purpose of Batch Dialing  
- Control the **number of simultaneous calls** to match agent or system capacity.  
- Prevent overloading telephony systems or network bandwidth.  
- Ensure **quality of interactions** by avoiding rushed conversations.  
- Maintain compliance with regulatory or campaign-specific limits.

## 2. Setting Up Batch Dialing  
1. Navigate to *Campaigns â†’ Dialing Settings*.  
2. Define **batch size**: the number of leads called simultaneously.  
3. Configure **time windows** for dialing (e.g., business hours).  
4. Set **retry logic** for unanswered calls or failed connections.  
5. Enable **pausing or throttling** options if system or agent capacity is exceeded.

## 3. Setting Call Limits  
- **Daily / hourly limits:** Control how many calls each agent or campaign can make.  
- **Lead limits per batch:** Prevent repeatedly dialing the same lead in a short period.  
- **Concurrency limits:** Set maximum simultaneous calls per agent or system instance.  
- **Credit management:** Ensure enough campaign credits are available before starting batches.  

---

## 4. Best Practices  
- Start with **smaller batch sizes** to monitor agent performance and system load.  
- Gradually increase batch sizes as confidence in agent behavior grows.  
- Regularly review call logs and outcomes to adjust limits for optimal results.  
- Use batch dialing in combination with **retry and fallback strategies** to maximize lead engagement.

<Tip>  
Batch dialing ensures campaigns are efficient, manageable, and compliant. Adjust batch sizes and limits based on system capacity, agent availability, and lead responsiveness.
