### How It Works

| Trigger | AI Action | SMS Sent |
|--------|----------|---------|
| "Text me the link" | Detects intent | "Hi John, here's your appt: [link]" |
| Call ends (booked) | Auto-confirm | "Your appt is Tue 3pm. Reply STOP to opt-out" |
| Missed call | Voicemail drop | "We tried calling. Call back at +1555..." |
