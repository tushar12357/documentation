### How It Works
1. Click **Create New Agent** → **Talk to AI**.
2. Type or speak your request:
   > “Create a friendly female agent named Sarah who books dental appointments, speaks Spanish, and syncs with GoHighLevel calendar.”

3. AI generates:
   - Full prompt
   - Voice selection
   - Calendar integration
   - Transfer rules

4. Review & tweak (optional).
5. Click **Generate Agent**.

### Assign Generated Agent to a Client (Agency Workflow)

Once your agent is created, **push it to any client’s portal** in under 30 seconds:

1. **Go to Client Portal**  
   From your **Agency Dashboard** → **Clients** → **Manage Subaccounts**

2. **Select an Existing Client**  
   Click on the client you want to assign the agent to (e.g., “ABC Dental Clinic”).

3. **Assign the Agent**  
   - Click **+ Assign Agent**  
   - Search for your newly created **Talk to AI agent**  
   - Select it and click **Next**

4. **Paste & Customize for Client**  
   - **Brand Override**: Paste client-specific logo, name, or greeting  
   - **CRM Mapping**: Connect to their GHL, Salesforce, or Cal.com  
   - **Permissions**: Choose `Edit`, `View Only`, or `No Access`  
   - **Domain**: Enable custom domain (e.g., `ai.abcclinic.com`)

5. **Deploy & Notify**  
   - Click **Assign & Deploy**  
   - The agent instantly appears in the **client’s dashboard** under their branding  
   - Auto-email sent: “Your AI Phone Agent is live!”

### Best Practices
- Be **specific** about goal, tone, language, and tools.
- Mention **accent** (e.g., “British English”) if needed.
- Avoid jargon — talk like you’re briefing a new employee.
- **Always clone** the master agent before assigning to clients.
