### Why Clone?
- Test new prompts without breaking production.
- Create per-client versions with custom branding.
- Launch seasonal campaigns (e.g., Holiday Sales).

### Steps to Clone
1. Go to **Agents** list.
2. Find the agent → Click **More** → **Clone**.
3. Enter a new name (e.g., `SalesBot - Client X`).
4. Choose to copy:
   - Prompt & settings
   - Integrations
   - Call history & analytics
5. Click **Clone Agent**.

### Post-Clone Actions
- Update prompt with client-specific details.
- Reassign to new phone number or campaign.
- Test in **Playground** before live.
