### 1. Access the Agent Builder  
- Go to the **Agents** page in your dashboard.  
- Click **Create New Agent** to open the agent creation options.  
- You’ll see four ways to get started:  
  1. **Create from Scratch** – Build a new agent manually with full control.  
  2. **Talk to AI** – Describe your agent in natural language and let the platform auto-generate it.  
  3. **Use Template** – Choose from ready-to-use agent templates for common use cases (e.g., real estate follow-ups, appointment scheduling).  
  4. **Upload Script** – Import an existing script or call flow to instantly create an agent.

---

### 2. Choose Model, Voice & Language  
- After your agent is created, you can configure its intelligence and voice:  
  - **Select LLM model:** Choose the large language model (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) that powers your agent’s understanding and responses.  
  - **Select voice:** Pick from male/female options, various tones, and emotional styles.  
  - **Select language and accent:** Match your agent’s audience for localization and clarity.  
  - **Add base prompt:** Define your agent’s personality, purpose, and communication tone.

---

### 3. Configure Core Settings  
- **Voice Settings:** Adjust speaking rate, pitch, pauses, and emotional tone.  
- **Call Settings:** Define retry limits, call duration, concurrency, and time windows.  
- **Post-Call Analysis:** Enable transcription, call summaries, sentiment analysis, and CRM data updates.

---

### 4. Calendar & CRM Integrations  
- Connect your preferred calendar systems to enable automatic appointment booking and scheduling:  
  - **Cal.com**  
  - **GoHighLevel (GHL)**  
  - **Salesforce**  
- Map event types and availability windows so your AI agent can book meetings directly during calls.

---

### 5. Advanced Features  
- **Call Transfer:** Route live calls to human agents or departments based on lead intent or keywords.  
- **Custom Triggers & Automations:** Link workflows via Zapier, Make, or direct APIs.  
- **Whitelabel Branding:** Customize the agent name, caller ID, and experience under your brand.  
- **Versioning & Rollback:** Keep multiple versions of the same agent and revert to earlier ones if needed.

---

### 6. Save & Deploy  
- Review all configurations and **save your agent**.  
- Test the flow using the built-in **Playground** or **Preview mode**.  
- Once verified, **launch the agent** by assigning it to a campaign or workflow.

<Tip>  
Start simple — for example, a lead qualification agent or appointment scheduler — and then expand with call transfers, integrations, and analytics once your base setup runs smoothly.
