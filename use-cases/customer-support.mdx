# Customer Support Automation

CloserX enables businesses to provide **scalable, 24/7 voice-based customer support** without expanding their call center staff.  
AI agents can resolve FAQs, collect feedback, route escalations, and ensure that customers always receive timely and consistent assistance.

## üéØ Objective

Empower your support teams with AI agents that:
- Handle routine customer inquiries instantly  
- Escalate complex issues to human representatives  
- Capture post-call data for continuous improvement  

> With CloserX, every support call becomes a learning opportunity ‚Äî helping you measure, refine, and improve CX metrics over time.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Inbound Call Handling**  
   - Customers call your support number routed through CloserX.  
   - The AI agent greets them naturally and identifies intent using voice understanding.  

2. **Knowledge Base Integration**  
   - The agent references your product/service knowledge base in real time.  
   - Answers FAQs, resolves common troubleshooting steps, or guides the customer.  

3. **Escalation Flow**  
   - If the agent detects frustration, urgency, or unhandled intent, it transfers the call to a live representative.  
   - All call context and transcript snippets are passed to the human agent.  

4. **Post-Call Actions**  
   - CloserX logs the call summary, sentiment, and resolution status.  
   - Follow-up SMS or email can be automatically triggered.
