## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload Lead List or CRM Integration**  
   - Import leads from CSV or sync directly from systems like Salesforce or GoHighLevel.  
   - Define mapping for key fields like name, company, phone, and tags.  

2. **Agent Configuration**  
   - Create a specialized sales agent with a friendly, persuasive tone.  
   - Configure the script or prompt with clear call objectives (e.g., “Book a demo” or “Gauge product interest”).  

3. **Campaign Setup**  
   - Set the campaign type to **Outbound**.  
   - Define daily call limits, retry logic, and local time restrictions.  
   - Choose the caller ID or number pool for your campaign.  

4. **Lead Qualification Flow**  
   - Build branching logic:  
     - “If interested → schedule meeting.”  
     - “If busy → set callback.”  
     - “If not interested → tag as cold.”  
   - Configure CRM updates and webhook triggers for each outcome.  

5. **Monitoring & Optimization**  
   - Track campaign performance from the dashboard.  
   - Review call recordings and transcripts.  
   - Adjust tone, pacing, and prompt design for better conversions.
