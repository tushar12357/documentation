## UI vs API Workflow Overview  
You can create and manage AI agents using either the **platform UI** or the **API**. Choosing the right approach depends on your workflow, automation needs, and scale.

---

## 1. UI Workflow  
- **Ideal for:** small teams, manual setup, visual inspection, or one-off campaigns.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Navigate through the platform dashboard.  
  2. Click to create a new agent.  
  3. Configure scripts, prompts, language, voice, and knowledge base via forms.  
  4. Assign the agent to campaigns and test calls in playground mode.  
- **Pros:** Intuitive, visual, easy to explore options.  
- **Cons:** Harder to scale or automate; requires manual intervention.  

---

## 2. API Workflow  
- **Ideal for:** large-scale deployments, automation, integrations with CRM or lead systems.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Authenticate via API key.  
  2. Create agents programmatically with JSON payloads.  
  3. Assign scripts, prompts, voice settings, and knowledge base references.  
  4. Launch campaigns and monitor outcomes via API endpoints.  
- **Pros:** Automates repetitive tasks, integrates with existing systems, supports bulk operations.  
- **Cons:** Requires programming knowledge and understanding of API endpoints.

## 3. When to Use Each  
| Use Case | Recommended Workflow |
|----------|--------------------|
| Single campaign / one-off agent | UI |
| Multiple campaigns or agents | API |
| Continuous integration with CRM | API |
| Testing, preview, experimentation | UI |
| Large-scale lead processing | API |

---

## 4. Hybrid Approach  
- Use **UI** for initial setup, testing, and agent preview.  
- Use **API** for bulk updates, campaign scheduling, and automated reporting.  
- This approach leverages the strengths of both methods.

<Tip>  
Start with the **UI** for learning and experimentation. Once confident, switch to the **API** for scaling, automation, and integrating into your workflows.
