## Language & Voices Overview  
This section explains how to configure your AI agent’s **language, accent, and voice style** to match your campaign audience. Proper selection improves call naturalness, lead engagement, and overall effectiveness.

---

## 1. Selecting Language  
- Choose the **primary language** your agent will use during calls.  
- Consider the **target audience** and regional preferences.  
- Some platforms support **multilingual agents**, allowing fallback to a secondary language if needed.  

---

## 2. Selecting Voice & Accent  
- Select the **voice model** (male/female) and accent (e.g., US English, UK English, Indian English).  
- Ensure the accent aligns with the **geographic region** of your leads for natural conversation.  
- Different voice models may have unique qualities (tone, clarity, pacing) — test multiple to see which works best.  

---

## 3. Voice Styles & Personality  
- Define the **tone of the agent**: professional, friendly, persuasive, casual, etc.  
- Some platforms allow **customization of speech patterns**: speed, pitch, pauses, and emphasis.  
- Align voice style with the **campaign purpose** and brand guidelines.  

---

## 4. Testing Language & Voices  
- Use the **playground/test mode** to preview agent calls in different languages and voices.  
- Ensure pronunciation is correct and the conversation feels natural.  
- Test dynamic variable insertion (e.g., lead names, product info) in different languages.  

---

## 5. Best Practices  
- Keep voice consistent across the campaign for brand familiarity.  
- Match tone with **audience expectations**: professional for B2B, friendly for B2C.  
- Re-test periodically after platform updates or new voice models are released.

A natural-sounding, region-appropriate voice increases lead trust and engagement. Start simple, then experiment with voice styles, accents, and pacing to find the best combination for your campaigns.
