## Build Overview  
This section guides you through how to **build**, **configure**, and **launch** AI voice agents on the platform. It covers the end-to-end process from initial setup to agent deployment, so you can get live quickly and scale with confidence.

### Why this phase matters  
In the Build phase you define *how* your agents will behave: what they say, how they respond, how they integrate into your campaigns, and how they connect to your data (CRM, leads). A well-designed build leads to higher success rates, better conversational flow, and greater ROI on call campaigns.

### Key steps in the Build phase  
Here are the major steps you’ll follow:

1. **Platform Setup & Branding**  
   - Configure your account, brand the platform (white-label if applicable), and set up team access and permissions.  
   - Define your organizational structure: sub accounts, client accounts, agent groups.  
   
2. **Agent Definition**  
   - Create an AI voice agent: name it, assign a “personality” (tone, voice, script style).  
   - Choose or upload a script/call-flow: define prompts, questions, branches.  
   - Upload any custom audio or recordings if you use them for training.  
   
3. **Knowledge & Data Integration**  
   - Attach a knowledge-base or lead-data source so your agent can refer to real information (e.g., CRM records, client details).  
   - Set up CRM integrations and other data-sync tools so the agent can read/write relevant data.  
   
4. **Voice & Language Configuration**  
   - Select the voice (male/female), accent, and language for the agent.  
   - Configure telephony parameters: caller ID, number provisioning, DNC lists, retry logic.  
   
5. **Testing & Preview**  
   - Use the built-in test or playground mode to simulate calls, check conversation flow, and debug logic.  
   - Test edge cases like voicemails, no answer, callback lives, agent hand-over to human.  
   
6. **Campaign Assignment & Launch Readiness**  
   - Assign the agent to a campaign: upload leads, set time windows, concurrency limits, retries.  
   - Verify usage quotas, calling credits, and readiness for outbound/inbound calls.  
   - Launch the agent live when ready — monitor initial calls closely for any adjustments.

<Tip>  
During the Build phase, favour simplicity in your first agent: choose a short script, one voice, and one direct goal (e.g., “book appointment”). Once you have one working agent, scale to multiple agents, languages and use-cases.
