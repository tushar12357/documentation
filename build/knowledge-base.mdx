## Knowledge-Base Overview  
A **knowledge base** (KB) is a structured collection of information that your AI agents can access to answer questions, reference data, or guide conversations during calls. Integrating a knowledge base ensures your agents are informed and provide accurate responses to leads or customers.

---

## 1. Purpose of Knowledge Base  
- Store FAQs, product/service details, scripts, and client-specific information.  
- Allow AI agents to **dynamically reference data** during conversations.  
- Reduce errors and improve the relevance and quality of agent responses.  
- Enable consistent messaging across campaigns and agents.  

---

## 2. Types of Knowledge Bases  
- **Internal KB**: Stored within your platform, typically editable via a dashboard.  
- **External KB**: Connected via APIs, webhooks, or CRM systems to fetch live data.  
- **Hybrid KB**: Combines internal and external sources for comprehensive coverage.  

---

## 3. Setting Up a Knowledge Base  
1. Navigate to *Knowledge-Base → Create New KB*.  
2. Provide a **name** and **description** for the knowledge base.  
3. Choose the **source type** (internal, external, hybrid).  
4. Upload or input data:  
   - Text files, spreadsheets, JSON, or structured content.  
   - Include FAQs, call scripts, product details, or customer info.  
5. Configure **access rules**: define which agents or campaigns can use this KB.  

---

## 4. Connecting Knowledge Base to Agents  
- Assign your KB to one or multiple AI agents in the *Agent Settings → Knowledge Base* section.  
- Agents will automatically reference the KB when generating responses during calls.  
- Set **priority or fallback rules** if multiple KBs are connected (e.g., internal KB first, then external API).  

---

## 5. Testing & Updating KB  
- Use the **playground/test mode** to ensure the agent retrieves correct data from the KB.  
- Update the KB regularly to include new information, correct errors, or improve coverage.  
- Keep track of KB versions for rollback or agent re-training if needed.

<Tip>  
A well-maintained knowledge base improves agent performance, reduces failed calls, and ensures consistent messaging across campaigns. Start with a small, high-priority dataset and expand over time.
