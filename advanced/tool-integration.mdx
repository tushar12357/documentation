# Tool Integration

CloserX.ai is built to **seamlessly integrate** with your favorite tools — from CRMs and telephony providers to automation platforms like Zapier and webhooks for real-time event handling.

This guide explains how to connect, configure, and extend CloserX.ai’s functionality through external tools and APIs.

## 1. Why Integrate Tools?

Integrations enable you to:
- Sync leads, calls, and outcomes with your **CRM**.  
- Automate tasks like follow-ups, SMS reminders, and report generation.  
- Push analytics data to dashboards or BI tools.  
- Trigger **custom workflows** in your existing ecosystem.  

> Example: After a successful AI call, automatically mark the lead as “Contacted” in your CRM and send a summary email to your sales rep.

## 3. CRM Integration

### Setup Steps
1. Go to **Integrations → CRM → Connect**.  
2. Choose your CRM provider (e.g., GoHighLevel).  
3. Authenticate via API key or OAuth.  
4. Map fields between CloserX.ai and your CRM:
   - Lead name → `contact_name`
   - Call result → `status`
   - Next follow-up → `task_due`

### Example Workflow
When an AI agent books a meeting:
- The lead is updated in your CRM as **"Booked"**.  
- A **calendar invite** is automatically generated.  
- A **Slack notification** is sent to the assigned team.

## 4. Zapier Integration

Zapier lets you connect CloserX.ai with 6,000+ apps — **no code required**.

### Example Zaps:
- When a call is **completed**, send a **summary email**.  
- When a **new lead** is added to CRM, trigger an **AI call campaign**.  
- When a **voicemail** is detected, create a **follow-up task** in Notion.

### Setup:
1. Create a new Zap → **Trigger: Webhook (Catch Hook)**.  
2. Copy the generated Zapier URL.  
3. Paste it into CloserX.ai under **Webhooks → Add Endpoint**.  
4. Map call data fields in your Zap (e.g., lead_name, duration, transcript).

## 5. Webhook Automation

For more advanced workflows, use **native webhooks** to handle real-time event data.

### Common Event Types:
- `call.started`
- `call.completed`
