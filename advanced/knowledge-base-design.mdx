# Knowledge Base Design

A well-designed knowledge base (KB) is essential for enabling your AI agents to **understand your business context**, answer questions intelligently, and maintain accurate, goal-oriented conversations.

This guide covers how to **structure**, **train**, and **optimize** your knowledge base for high recall and natural dialogue on CloserX.ai.

## 1. Purpose of the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base powers your AI agent’s **factual understanding** and **context retrieval**.

It helps the agent:
- Access real-time company or product data.
- Answer domain-specific questions confidently.
- Reference stored information mid-conversation (e.g., pricing, policies, hours).
- Maintain brand accuracy and compliance across all agents.

> Think of it as your agent’s internal library — everything it needs to know before and during the call.

## 2. Knowledge Base Structure

A good knowledge base is modular and organized for clarity and retrievability.

### Recommended Structure

| Section | Content Type | Example |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Company Info** | Overview, mission, team, contact details | “We’re a real estate automation platform helping agents close deals faster.” |
| **Product / Service Details** | Offerings, features, pricing tiers | “Our Premium plan includes AI scheduling and CRM sync.” |
| **Process / Workflow Docs** | How calls, bookings, or follow-ups work | “Agents confirm leads and book slots via Calendly.” |
| **Objection Handling** | Common customer hesitations with sample responses | “If user says ‘I need to talk to my manager’, respond politely with a follow-up option.” |
| **Legal / Compliance** | Privacy policies, disclaimers, permissions | “Calls are recorded for training and quality purposes.” |

## 3. Data Sources & Sync Options

CloserX.ai supports multiple KB sources to ensure your agents always have the most up-to-date context.

### Supported Types:
- **Manual Entries:** Add text blocks, FAQs, and instructions directly.  
- **File Uploads:** Import PDFs, CSVs, or Markdown documents.  
- **API Integration:** Sync with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, GoHighLevel) or CMS platforms.  
- **Live Retrieval:** Use connected APIs for real-time data access (e.g., product stock or scheduling availability).  

### Example:
> Sync your “Pricing” section daily from your website API, while “Company Policy” remains a static Markdown file.

## 4. Best Practices for Knowledge Organization

✅ **Keep entries atomic:** Each document or block should cover a single topic.  
✅ **Use consistent headings:** Helps retrieval models understand hierarchy.  
✅ **Tag documents:** Use tags like `pricing`, `legal`, `faq` for faster filtering.  
✅ **Regularly update:** Schedule auto-refreshes for time-sensitive data.  
✅ **Embed examples:** For each policy or fact, include a sample question and expected answer.  

Example:
```markdown
### Pricing Policy
Our standard consultation call costs $50.

**Example Question:**  
"What is the consultation fee?"
**Expected Answer:**  
"Our consultation fee is $50 per session."
