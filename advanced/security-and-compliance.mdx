# Security and Compliance

At CloserX, we take **security, privacy, and regulatory compliance** seriously. Our platform is built with enterprise-grade safeguards to protect both your data and your customers’ interactions.

---

## 🔒 Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest & in Transit:**  
  All sensitive data, including call recordings, transcripts, and lead information, are encrypted using **AES-256** at rest and **TLS 1.3** in transit.

- **Secure Infrastructure:**  
  CloserX is deployed on **AWS** with isolated VPCs, private subnets, and role-based access control (RBAC) for every service layer.

- **Access Control:**  
  Team members and integrations are governed by granular permission scopes and **OAuth 2.0**–based authentication.

---

## 🧩 Compliance Standards

- **GDPR & CCPA Ready:**  
  CloserX complies with leading data protection frameworks, enabling global teams to process user data responsibly.

- **SOC 2 Type II & ISO 27001 (In Progress):**  
  We’re continuously improving our security posture to meet strict audit and certification standards.

- **Call and Message Logging Policies:**  
  Customers can configure **retention periods**, **redaction rules**, and **data anonymization** for call data and transcripts.

---

## 🧠 AI Model Privacy

- **No Training on Customer Data:**  
  Your proprietary data, prompts, or call recordings are **never used** to train shared models.  
  Models are sandboxed to ensure no cross-tenant data leakage.

- **Redacted Metadata:**  
  Sensitive identifiers (like phone numbers or emails) are automatically redacted before AI processing when enabled.

## 🛡️ Infrastructure Resilience

- **Uptime & Monitoring:**  
  CloserX maintains **99.9% uptime** with real-time health checks and redundancy across multiple availability zones.

- **Incident Response:**  
  Automated alerting and human-in-the-loop monitoring ensure fast detection and resolution of anomalies.

## 🧾 Customer Controls

- **Data Portability:**  
  Export transcripts, recordings, and reports anytime through our dashboard or API.

- **Audit Logs:**  
  Every administrative action is logged and reviewable, ensuring full transparency.

- **Custom Retention Settings:**  
  Define data lifecycles that align with your organization’s compliance policy.

## ⚙️ Best Practices
